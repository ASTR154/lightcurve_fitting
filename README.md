# lightcurve_fitting

This package contains tools to fit analytical models to multiband light curves of astronomical transients.

For a quick guide to get started, see the included Jupyter notebook [lightcurve_fitting.ipynb](lightcurve_fitting.ipynb).

The documentation is a bit sparse right now, but feel free to contact the author for help.
